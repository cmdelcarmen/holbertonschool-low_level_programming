| File | Task |
| ---- | ---- |
|0-positive_or_negative.c  | This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative. |
|1-last_digit.c | This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n. |
|2-print_alphabet.c | Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line. (Can only use putchar.) |
|3-print_alphabets.c | Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line. (Can only use putchar.) |
|4-print_alphabt.c | Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line. (Can only use putchar.) |
|5-print_numbers.c | Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line. |
|6-print_numberz.c | Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line. (Can only use putchar, no char variables) |
|7-print_tebahpla.c | Write a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line. (Can only use putchar.) |
|8-print_base16.c | Write a program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line. (Can only use putchar.) |
|9-print_comb.c | Write a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers. (Can only use putchar, no char variables.) |
|100-print_comb3.c |Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits. (01 and 10 are considered same combo, print smallest version, can only use putchar, no char types.) |
|101-print_comb4.c |Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits. (Same rules as 101-print_comb3.c) |
|102-print_comb5.c |Write a program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers. (Same rules as 101-print_comb3.c) |
